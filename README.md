This is a collection of winners of an event I held, 'Sokoban Golf', which is to create a 20x20 sokoban with only one box that needs many many moves to solve.

The event is inspired by the puzzle 'Marathon Block Pushing Game' from MIT Mystery Hunt 2024.

The event was held at Luogu or 洛谷, a Chinese website mainly for competitive programming, especially Olympiad in Informatics.

The winners' puzzles is visualized by [PuzzleScript Plus](https://auroriax.github.io/PuzzleScript/index.html).

In-puzzle move counter is copied from [Count Mover](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=ed8845d930c8940bef1236cf18ca5bd2).
